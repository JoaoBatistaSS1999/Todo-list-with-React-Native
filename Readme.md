# React Native TODO list

## ⚠️ WARNING: This app was not tested on IOS ⚠️

## 📝 Instructions :

- Clone this repo
- Run "npm install" to install all the dependecies then "npm start" to open the app
- Install the EXPO-GO APP from the Play Store and use it to read the QR code that will be displaied on your terminal

### 🎓 Concepts I learned today:

- How React Native compiles one component to two different versions (for android and IOS)
- Difference between EXPO CLI and React Native CLI
- View component can't display text directly like HTML (adds a "p" tag automaticaly)
- View is flex-column by default
- Styling does not cascade
- Flatlists have lazy loading
- Button is styled in a diffent
- Errors are crystal clear



## 👉 Features of the app

- Task List with item that disappear on press
- Modal pop-up
- Two-way binding for cleaning the input after cancel/set value

<div class="flex-container"><!-- .element: style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%; justify-content: center;" -->
  <img src="./assets/app/list.jpg" height="500" width="300"><!-- .element: style="margin: 10px; padding: 20px;"-->
<img src="./assets/app/modal.jpg"  height="500" width="300"><!-- .element: style="margin: 10px; padding: 20px;"-->
</div>
<hr/>

- Show a placeholder element when the list is empty
